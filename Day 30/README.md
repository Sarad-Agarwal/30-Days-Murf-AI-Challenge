## 🏁 The Journey Comes Full Circle

30 days ago, I began the challenge of building an **AI Voice Agent from scratch**.
Today, I present to you the final product: **MARVIS grown JARVIS** – a voice-powered digital companion capable of **real-time speech, intelligent responses, and web-powered insights** 🌐✨.

This README is a reflection of the **entire journey**, from the first line of code to the final deployment.

## 📖 Highlights of the Journey

✅ **30 Days of Consistency** – Building step by step, feature by feature.
✅ **Real-Time Voice Agent** – Streaming Speech-to-Text (STT) + Large Language Model (LLM) + Text-to-Speech (TTS).
✅ **Smarter Conversations** – Integrated web search for up-to-date knowledge.
✅ **Customizable Agent** – Users can enter their own API keys for full control.
✅ **Modern UI** – Interactive, responsive, and fun to use.
✅ **Cloud Deployment** – Publicly accessible agent hosted on Render.
